rm command in Linux with examples

Syntax rm [OPTION]... FILE...

rm a.txt   // File a.txt is deleted

rm -i d.txt // Interative Deletion :  the -i option makes the command ask the user for confirmation before 	    // removing each file, you have to press y for confirm deletion

rm -f file.txt  // rm prompts for confirmation removal if a file is write protected. The -f option overrides this 		// minor protection and removes the file forcefully
rm -r Dir 	// To delete a directory
