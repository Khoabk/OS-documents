- count_mutex : when executing pthread_mutex_lock(&count_mutex ) if this is the first thread to call this function, it is enabled to enter the critical section, as long as the current thread does not call pthread_mutex_unlock(&count_mutex ), no other thread can enter the critical section when calling pthread_mutex_lock(&count_mutex ). Simply saying count_mutex is like a lock, pthread_mutex_lock is like a locking key and pthread_mutex_unlock is the unlocking key.

- cont_threshold_cv: is used to halt the execution of thread 1 when being called in pthread_cond_wait(&count_threshold_cv ,&count_mutex ) function, at this time it halts and enables other threads to execute, once the count value has reached 20 count_threshold is unlocked by calling pthread_cond_signal(&count_threshold_cv ), however only when cont_mutex is unlock will it be able to continue execution.
